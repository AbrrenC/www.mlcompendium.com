# The Machine & Deep Learning Compendium

**The following is my personal compendium, which includes many topics, links, summaries in the fields of statistics, machine learning, deep learning, computer science, data science, deep vision, NLP, cloud computing, product management, and others.**

**I see this compendium as a gateway and as a frequently visited resource for people of proficiency levels, for industry data scientists as well as academics.**

**Previously the ML-Compendium was in a** [**400-page google doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvtcwc8LOb3PZI9huQOD7UjqUoY98N5r3aQsWKNAlzk/edit)**, but It has gone fully open-source and is now hosted on** [**Gitbook**](https://book.mlcompendium.com) **&** [**Github**](https://github.com/orico/www.mlcompendium.com/tree/master) **\(please star it\).**

**Please keep in mind that this is a perpetual work in progress with a variety of topics. If you feel that something should be changed, please use the comment option and let me know.**
